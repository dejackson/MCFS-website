THINGS TO DO!

Format Home Pages Correctly

Manager Page: 2 large links in the middle of the page

General Public: finished

Student Home: Sidebar links + form with info in the middle (not sure how to do this?)

Make sure we have generic pages for the homepage links. 

Change cash register to buttons if time.
